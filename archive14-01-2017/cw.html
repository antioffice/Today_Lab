      <div>The industry of Commercial Real Estate – including development, management and client relationship models – have not changed much since the 19th century. Focused primarily on minimizing risks, and resorting to proven tools to leverage value of properties, traditional developers have long been reluctant to take more proactive approach. In the face of disruption, however, taking no risks is becoming the biggest risk of all.
        <br>
        <br>This project, conducted for Cushman &amp; Wakefield in Moscow, challenges the status quo of the industry to redefine user-developer relationship model and increase the value of property in a more appropriate way for the networked age.

        <div class="inbody titlecw">Challenge</div>
        <div class="textcw">In early 2016, in the midst of political and economical unrest, commercial real estate sector in Russia is facing challenging times.&nbsp;The overall&nbsp;vacancy&nbsp;rate in Moscow is high at&nbsp;19.1%, with some of the higher end properties&nbsp;vacant up to 49%.&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>While SMB and entrepreneurs are growing in numbers, most potential tenants, are reluctant to commit for traditional long-term lease contracts. On other hand, developers, unable to respond to the changing demands of the market, are left in suspension, with exposition periods reaching 3 years and more for some of the properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>Waiting through might be&nbsp;a decent strategy if the old times are to be back soon. But what if it was a smarter way? Cushman&amp;Wakefield asked us to help.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="column20 w-col w-col-4">
        <div class="inbody titlecw">Solution</div>
        <div class="textcw">At its core, our approach is based on the belief that it is more productive to embrace the change, rather than trying to resist it.&nbsp;We outline the framework for adaptive property management model that capitalizes on the seemingly negative tendencies, turning them into competitive advantages.&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>Using Ducat Place III in Moscow as a case study, we demonstrate how&nbsp;tapping into the potential of technology and changing the angle we look at the leasing and contractual systems makes possible for series of opportunities to be unlocked. These constitute attracting new tenants by better responding to their needs, increasing operating income by utilizing capacity of building more efficiently, and aligning interests of the main stakeholders by altering incentive models.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="column20 w-col w-col-4">
        <div class="inbody titlecw">Result</div>
        <div class="textcw">In the process of business model simulation, we have seen operating income of Ducat Place III&nbsp;increase up to 30%, owing to optimized use of resources, and business model innovation. As the operating income is one of the key factors that determine value of property, increase of the monthly bottom line directly impacts the market value of the property.&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>The project was well received at Cushman&amp;Wakefield, and has since become the starting point for several initiatives both internally and outside the organization.

    <div class="_700">
      <div class="textcw white">Having started upstream the brief, we had to identify the scope, and frame of the challenge ourselves. To do that we looked extensively at the industry from different vantage points in order to map it thoroughly, identify interdependencies and understand the best point to channel our efforts.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>Throughout the six weeks, we conducted the research of relevant macro-trends affecting the industry from within, as well as series of interviews and workshops with the key stakeholders including developers, architects, brokers, tenants and end users in order to better understand the business processes, constraints, possibilities, motivations, beliefs and goals of each group involved.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>Finally, having mapped the insights and identified the pain-points, we investigated current value propositions and parts where it can be improved in the light of new technological possibilities and interests of the stakeholders.</div>

      <div class="textcw white">Having conducted and mapped the research, we have identified commonalities, and clustered the insights—both forces affecting the industry of real estate in general, as well as workspace environment in particular—into groups.

      <div class="textcw white">As a result, we ended up with the array of different factors and interdependencies related to our area of inquiry. Some we could affect directly, while other were completely out of anyone's control, which meant we had to embrace it and adapt.
        <br>
        <br>The biggest challenge, however—acknowledging that we are unable to change all the system at once—was to identify where to direct our efforts towards. In other words, which aspect, if changed, would result in the most meaningful change and would unlock opportunities to affect other parts of the ecosystem.</div>

      <div class="column20 w-col w-col-4">
        <div class="textcw">First, recognizing that we live in uncertain times, instead of trying to anticipate the trends and predict the future, we propose a responsive and adaptive framework, that is aimed at establishing alignment between—and maximizing value for—the&nbsp;key stakeholders.&nbsp;Instead of predicting upfront what value should be delivered in a top-down fashion, our solution reserves a room for inputs from the stakeholders, thus&nbsp;ensuring the longer-term viability of the property.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="column20 w-col w-col-4">
        <div class="textcw">Secondly, recognizing that systemic problems can’t be solved through the creation of physical artifacts only, we deliberately shift our focus to the software—as opposed to hardware—parts of the problem.&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>Careful to suggest that better architecture could be the solution, we focus on what intangible factors—including policy, lease terms, incentive models—should be addressed in order to initiate meaningful change and to establish more fertile ground for future evolution that would enable to develop and run physical buildings more like digital services.</div>
