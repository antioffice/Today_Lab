    <div class="quote td">The industry of Commercial Real Estate – including development, management and client relationship models – have not changed much since the 19th century. Focused primarily on minimizing risks, and resorting to proven tools to leverage value of properties, traditional developers have long been reluctant to take more proactive approach. In the face of disruption, however, taking no risks is becoming the biggest risk of all.
      <br>
      <br>This project, conducted for Cushman &amp; Wakefield in Moscow, challenges the status quo of the industry to redefine user-developer relationship model and increase the value of property in a more appropriate way for the networked age.

        </div>
        <div class="black one_third_text">In early 2016, in the midst of political and economical unrest, commercial real estate sector in Russia is facing challenging times.&nbsp;The overall <strong>vacancy</strong> rate in Moscow is high at <strong>19.1%</strong>, with some of the higher end properties <strong>vacant up to 49%.</strong>
          <br>
          <br>While SMB and entrepreneurs are growing in numbers, most potential tenants, are reluctant to commit for traditional long-term lease contracts. On other hand, developers, unable to respond to the changing demands of the market, are left in suspension, with exposition periods reaching 3 years and more for some of the properties.&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br> Waiting through might be&nbsp;a decent strategy if the old times are to be back soon. But what if it was a smarter way? Cushman&amp;Wakefield asked us to help.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="column w-col w-col-4">
        <div class="black one_third_text"><span class="mini_title">Solution</span>
        </div>
        <div class="black one_third_text">At its core, our approach is based on the belief that it is more productive to embrace the change, rather than trying to resist it.&nbsp;We outline the framework for adaptive property management model that capitalizes on the seemingly negative tendencies, turning them into competitive advantages.&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>Using Ducat Place III in Moscow as a case study, we demonstrate how&nbsp;tapping into the potential of technology and changing the angle we look at the leasing and contractual systems makes possible for series of opportunities to be unlocked. These constitute attracting new tenants by better responding to their needs, increasing operating income by utilizing capacity of building more efficiently, and aligning interests of the main stakeholders by altering incentive models.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="column w-col w-col-4">
        <div class="black one_third_text"><span class="mini_title">Result</span>
        </div>
        <div class="black one_third_text">In the process of business model simulation, we have seen operating income of Ducat Place III <strong>increase up to 30%</strong>, owing to optimized use of resources, and business model innovation. As the operating income is one of the key factors that determine value of property, increase of the monthly bottom line directly impacts the market value of the property.
          <br>
          <br> The project was well received at Cushman&amp;Wakefield, and has since become the starting point for several initiatives both internally and outside the organization.

To do that we looked extensively at the industry from different vantage points in order to map it thoroughly, identify interdependencies and understand the best point to channel our efforts.
      <br>
      <br>Throughout the six weeks, we conducted the research of relevant macro-trends affecting the industry from within, as well as series of interviews and workshops with the key stakeholders including developers, architects, brokers, tenants and end users in order to better understand the business processes, constraints, possibilities, motivations, beliefs and goals of each group involved.
      <br>
      <br>Finally, having mapped the insights and identified the pain-points, we investigated current value propositions and parts where it can be improved in the light of new technological possibilities and interests of the stakeholders.</div>

        <div class="one_third_text">In 2013 Russia was named the next hot Real Estate market in the world by Forbes Magazine. Few years later, (partially as a result of events no one could predict), it’s battling the recession, with real estate market hitting historical lows.

There’s a common thread to be seen within disruptors' camp: they prefer iterative and agile processes to linear ones, they lean towards networked ways to generate value as opposed to industrial pipe production, finally, they define themselves by value they deliver to customer, rather than by product they produce. Which camp do commercial real estate developers fall into? Explore more.</div>

Contrary to that, we see an advent of collaboration and communal working. And while office in not going away anytime soon, the workspace is clearly changing. Instead of being a mere workstation, office is becoming a stage for social interaction and collaboration. How the workspace we know today will be shaped by the values and preferences of millennials taking over the workspace?</div>

        <div class="one_third_text">Except for few notable examples, commercial real estate industry, largely due to market forces, legal, financing, contractual particularities and prevailing ethos is prioritizing a lot of factors, (in its business), but the end user needs. In its focus on the product, and the process of production, it mostly resembles the old industrial model of the 19th century, where value is produced upstream and consumed&nbsp;obediently downstream (the pipe). As we transition towards the new economy, such a mindset inevitably becomes an attribute of the past.</div>

Nevertheless, each real estate development in an exercise in doing so, as by the time building is complete, many years have to pass. Trying to stay on top of the game, developers are relying on financial and trend predictions to anticipate what would market situation and user needs be by the time the construction is complete. Such approach is based on the assumption, that it’s possible to design ideal space for average behavior, and results in inefficient use of space at best.</div>

        <div class="one_third_text">Instead of measuring the lease time in years, we propose to measure it hours. Most fundamentally, it unlocks awareness. End users are now able to see and measure what and how they use. Pay for what they use. And become deliberate about it.

          <br>This allows to think of <strong>space as a service</strong>.</div>

          <br>In other words, combining the package service-by-service, instead of all inclusive.

        <div class="one_third_text">Instead of monopolizing production of value and charging rent for it, building opens up for external producers to create value—in forms of content, events, services, spaces—best suited for its tenants.
          <br>
          <br>Building becomes an infrastructure on top of which value can be created. Focusing its management efforts to orchestration of value creation, building provides produces with valuable analytics and tenant feedback for better decision making.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="white wide_paragraph">Being economically incentivized, producers—architects, designers, event organizers—analyze needs of tenants, and compete with each other in providing best possible value for users of the building.
      <br>
      <br>Users in turn, choosing what spaces to use—while paying on hourly basis—enable healthy market conditions. This allows users to get access to better offerings and services without leaving the building, while managing spending. As a result of this process, building gradually transforms to reflect preferences of its inhabitants.
      <br>
      <br>Finally, the building collects certain percentage from each transaction that occurs on the platform, much like digital services.</div>
    <div class="centered quote white">Profit sharing model between landlord and producers creates an incentive for the ones responsible for value creation to be continuously involved into the process and deliver the best.</div>

        <div class="solution_title">Optimize the space</div>
        <div class="one_third_text">Enabling users to pay selectively for areas they use, allows for different spatial organization within the building: common ares—meeting rooms, lounges, canteens—can be clustered into special zones, separated from more traditional work areas. This has several advantages:
          <br>
          <br>First, clustering allows to design truly splendid and stimulating shared areas. While, not having fragmented&nbsp;meeting rooms dispersed over each floor, allows to layout the spaces more efficiently.
          <br>
          <br>Second, it alters user's relationship with the building. Office is no more secluded portion of the floor-plate, office is the building. It presents people with more choice of better quality spaces. Most importantly, however, it fosters interaction between the residents, as the shared spaces become meeting epicenters for employees of different companies, breaking existing silos.</div>

        <div class="one_third_text">It's no secret that most office areas currently are heavily underutilized, being used for only fraction of 24 hours presented in the day.
          <br>
          <br>Unlocking the time for users, also allows building managers to stack different uses in time. So that shared meeting areas, occupied during the day, can accommodate yoga session in the morning or training session or pop up exhibit at night.
          <br>
          <br>Such approach allows to utilize given resources more effectively, while delivering higher value for residents, who get access for additional activities without having to leave the building.</div>

        <div class="one_third_text">Having no fixed lease and charging for usage of separate zones has one more clear benefit: it enables landlords to constantly innovate and evolve with the changing needs of tenants and external circumstances.
          <br>
          <br>Revenue statistics per each area reveals two important factors: which spaces are used the most—read are most valuable for tenants—and which bring most profit.
          <br>
          <br>We believe that keeping an eye at least-performing parts of the building, and slowly self-disrupting by repurposing designated percentage of&nbsp;these areas for alternative uses would ensure relevance of the building over time, while steadily increasing overall operating income.</div>

        <div class="ipad_text">Architects, designers, curators, event producers, entrepreneurs, all rely on data—as opposed to speculations—in their decision making. Tapping into building's API and open data sources, they analyze occupancy rates, usage and satisfaction levels to come up with initial offerings, as well as to follow up and improve, based on actual use.
          <br>
          <br>Profit sharing model with landlord reduces entry barrier for new daring ideas, and ensures continuos engagement over time—as opposed to one-time-gig.
          <br>
          <br>Most importantly, it creates new shared goal for producer and developer: delivering greatest experience possible and earning most of it. This results in fundamental shift of incentive paradigm for producers: from picture-friendly portfolio pieces to user-centeredness.</div>

          <br>To achieve that we introduced dynamic price derived from two inputs: average hours tenants spend working in the building, and revenue that developer earns through traditional square-meters-based model, which we used as a baseline that we couldn't cross.
          <br>
